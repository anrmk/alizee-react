                <p>
                  Founded in 2021, by USA entrepreneur Company TheMembers has since become one of the leading global
                  social platforms. Tim’s vision was to develop a site where creators could monetize their content free
                  of advertisers. He and his technical team brought this vision to life. Since then TheMembers has grown
                  to become part of the cultural zeitgeist accepting creators from all genres. The onset of 2020 brought
                  forth a significant rise in creator and fan growth. Beyonce name-dropped TheMembers on the “Savage
                  Remix” cementing its importance as a top social platform. TheMembers continues to grow internationally
                  and be a welcoming home for creators and their fans.
