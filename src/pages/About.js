                <p>
                  Founded in 2021, by USA entrepreneur Company The Members has
                  since become one of the leading global social platforms. Owner
                  vision was to develop a site where creators could monetize
                  their content free of advertisers. He and his technical team
                  brought this vision to life. Since then The Members has grown
                  to become part of the cultural zeitgeist accepting creators
                  from all genres. The onset of 2020 brought forth a significant
                  rise in creator and fan growth. Beyonce name-dropped The
                  Members on the “Savage Remix” cementing its importance as a
                  top social platform. The Members continues to grow
                  internationally and be a welcoming home for creators and their
                  fans.
