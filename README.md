# Alizee Platform

Alizee Platform is a community which gives you the freedom to be your own boss and to monetize your content. It's a space where you can express yourself without restrictions.
Users and creators have an opportunity to connect and collaborate with each other, build a closer relationship with each other

The platform provides a place where creativity never runs out
Content creators can earn money from users who subscribe to their content. Also our community could be a great start for everyone who was late with OF.
